# PetVet - International Project

### An easy way to stay informed about the health of your pets.

You need the android app to connect to the "PetVet scale". After you login or sign up you can add a pet name. 
After the name is added you can start the measurement. The app will try to connect and display the results when ready.
It will measure the weigth (its distribution), and the temperature. If these results are accurate you can save the measurement.
<br>
[The webapp](https://petvet-268116.web.app/) can be used to view previous measurement results.
If you are a vet you can use the webapp to view measurement results from all your connected clients.
<br>
A [live demo](https://ap.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=0ec85a0f-d598-4ed0-a042-aba900d65575) can be found on Panopto if you have access to our organisation.
