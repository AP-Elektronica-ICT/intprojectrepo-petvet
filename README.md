# PetVet - International Project

With PetVet you can easily monitor your pet's health, it can also be used by vets to follow up on procedures. 
With the android app you can connect to the "PetVet scale", in the app you can login and then add a pet name. After the name is added you can start the measurement. The scale will measure the weigth (its distribution), and the temperature.
You can also use the webapp [here](https://petvet-268116.web.app/) to view your previous measurement results.
