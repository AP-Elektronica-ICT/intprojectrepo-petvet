# PetVet - International Project

### An easy way to stay informed about the health of your pets.

You need the android app to connect to the 'PetVet scale'. After you login or sign up you can add a pet name. 
Then you can enter the name and start a measurement. The app will try to connect and display the results when ready.
It will measure the weight (its distribution), and the temperature. If the results are accurate you can save the measurement.

[The webapp](https://petvet-268116.web.app/) can be used to view previous measurement results.
If you are a vet you can use the webapp to view measurement results from all your connected clients.

A [live demo of the android app](https://ap.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=0ec85a0f-d598-4ed0-a042-aba900d65575) and
